#  Nitropack

> Next Generation Web Tooling

## 🚀 Quick Start

1️⃣ Create `api/test.ts`:

```ts [api/test.ts]
export default () => 'Nitro is amazing!'
```

2️⃣ Start development server with HMR using `npx nitropack dev` command:

> Your API is ready at http://localhost:3000/api/test

3️⃣ You can now build your production ready server:

```bash
npx nitropack build
````

4️⃣ Output is in `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any VPS with no dependencies. You can locally try it too:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

## 📚 Type Support

To add type support for any of nitropack's aliases within your project,
you may add the following to your tsconfig.json:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "paths": {
    "#nitro": ["nitropack/dist/runtime/index"],
    "#nitro/*": ["nitropack/dist/runtime/*.mjs"]
  }
}
```
