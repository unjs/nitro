 ❯ **Multi-provider** deployments with a single codebase and zero-configuration<br>
 ❯ **Portable and compact** deployments without `node_modules` dependency <br>
 ❯ **Directory structure** aware to register API routes and more with zero configuration <br>
 ❯ **Minimal Design** to fit into any solution with minimum overhead <br>
 ❯ **Code-splitting** and async chunk loading for fast server startup time <br>
 ❯ **TypeScript** fully supported <br>
 ❯ **Multi-driver storage** and caching layer <br>
 ❯ **Route caching** and static **pre-rendering** with built-in crawler <br>
 ❯ **Hackable** to extend almost any part of nitro using options <br>
 ❯ **Auto imports** for lazy folks and a tidy minimal codebase <br>
