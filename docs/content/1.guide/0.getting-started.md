# Getting Started

Let's create a new Nitro app in few steps.

## Starter Template

::callout
#summary
Make sure you have installed the recommended setup:
#content
* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) 👉 [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
* **Visual Studio Code**  [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
* [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for using pnpm and yarn. 👉 Run `corepack enable`
::

Create a new project using starter template:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

::

```sh
cd nitro-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
```

::


Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

🪄 Your API is ready at `http://localhost:3000/`

::alert
Check `.nitro/dev/index.mjs` if want to know what is happening
::

Build your production-ready server:

```bash
npm run build
````

Output is in the `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any provider with no dependencies.

You can try it locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```


## Edge Release Channel

Nitro offers an edge release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch.

You can opt-in to the edge release channel by updating your `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "^2.0.0"
++    "nitropack": "npm:nitropack-edge@latest"
  }
}
```

Remove an lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall the dependencies.
