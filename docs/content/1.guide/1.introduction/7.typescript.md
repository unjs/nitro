# TypeScript Support

Nitro supports TypeScript by default.

To add type hints within your project, you should add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "extends": "./.nitro/types/tsconfig.json"
}
```

Run `npx nitropack prepare` to generate the types for global auto-imports. This can be useful in a CI environment or as a `postinstall` command in your `package.json`.
