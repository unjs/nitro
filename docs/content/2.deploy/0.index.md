# Overview

Nitro can generate different output formats suitable for different hosting providers from the same code base.

Using built-in presets, you can easily configure Nitro to adjust it's output format with almost no additional code or configuration!

## Default output

Default production output preset is [Node.js server](/deploy/node).

When running Nitro in development mode, Nitro will always use a special preset called `nitro-dev` using Node.js with ESM in an isolated Worker environment with behavior as close as possible to the production environment.


## Zero-Config Providers

When deploying to the production using CI/CD, Nitro tries to automatically detect the provider environment and set the right one without any additional configuration. Currently, providers below can be auto-detected with zero config.

- [aws](/deploy/providers/aws)
- [azure](/deploy/providers/azure)
- [cloudflare pages](/deploy/providers/cloudflare#cloudflare-pages)
- [netlify](/deploy/providers/netlify)
- [stormkit](/deploy/providers/stormkit)
- [vercel](/deploy/providers/vercel)


## Changing the deployment preset

If you need to build Nitro against a specific provider, you can override it using an environment variable or `nitro.config.ts`. Using environment variable is recommended for deployments depending on CI/CD.

**Example:** Using `NITRO_PRESET`
```bash
NITRO_PRESET=aws_lambda nitro build
```

**Example:** Using [nitro.config.ts](/guide/configuration)

```ts
export default defineNitroConfig({
  preset: 'node-server'
})
```
