> Deploy Nitro apps to Azure Static Web apps or functions.

## Azure static web apps

**Preset:** `azure`

:read-more{title="Azure Static Web Apps" to="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static"}

::note
Integration with this provider is possible with [zero configuration](/deploy/#zero-config-providers).
::

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static) are designed to be deployed continuously in a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/github-actions-workflow). By default, Nitro will detect this deployment environment and enable the `azure` preset.

### Local preview

Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) if you want to test locally.

You can invoke a development environment to preview before deploying.

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=azure npx nypm@latest build
npx @azure/static-web-apps-cli start .output/public --api-location .output/server
```

### Configuration

Azure Static Web Apps are [configured](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration) using the `staticwebapp.config.json` file.

Nitro automatically generates this configuration file whenever the application is built with the `azure` preset.

Nitro will automatically add the following properties based on the following criteria:
| Property | Criteria | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[platform.apiRuntime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#platform)** | Will automatically set to `node:16` or `node:14` depending on your package configuration. | `node:16` |
| **[navigationFallback.rewrite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#fallback-routes)** | Is always `/api/server` | `/api/server` |
| **[routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#routes)** | All prerendered routes are added. Additionally, if you do not have an `index.html` file an empty one is created for you for compatibility purposes and also requests to `/index.html` are redirected to the root directory which is handled by `/api/server`.  | `[]` |

### Custom configuration

You can alter the Nitro generated configuration using `azure.config` option.

Custom routes will be added and matched first. In the case of a conflict (determined if an object has the same route property), custom routes will override generated ones.

### Deploy from CI/CD via GitHub actions

When you link your GitHub repository to Azure Static Web Apps, a workflow file is added to the repository.

When you are asked to select your framework, select custom and provide the following information:

| Input | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **app_location** | '/' |
| **api_location** | '.output/server' |
| **output_location** | '.output/public' |

If you miss this step, you can always find the build configuration section in your workflow and update the build configuration:

```yaml [.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-<RANDOM_NAME>.yml]
###### Repository/Build Configurations ######
app_location: '/'
api_location: '.output/server'
output_location: '.output/public'
###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
```

That's it! Now Azure Static Web Apps will automatically deploy your Nitro-powered application on push.

If you are using runtimeConfig, you will likely want to configure the corresponding [environment variables on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/application-settings).

## Azure functions

**Preset:** `azure_functions`

::important
If you encounter any issues, please ensure you're using a Node.js 16+ runtime. You can find more information about [how to set the Node version in the Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node?tabs=v2#setting-the-node-version).
Please see [unjs/nitro#2114](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/2114) for some common issues.

### Local preview

Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) if you want to test locally.

You can invoke a development environment from the serverless directory.

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=azure_functions npx nypm@latest build
cd .output
func start
```

You can now visit `http://localhost:7071/` in your browser and browse your site running locally on Azure Functions.

### Deploy from your local machine

To deploy, just run the following command:

```bash
# To publish the bundled zip file
az functionapp deployment source config-zip -g <resource-group> -n <app-name> --src dist/deploy.zip
# Alternatively you can publish from source
cd dist && func azure functionapp publish --javascript <app-name>
```

### Building for Azure Functions version 4.x

To build for the Azure Functions runtime version 4.x, set the Nitro compatibility environment variable to 2024-05-29.

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=azure_functions NITRO_COMPATIBILITY_DATE=2024-05-29 npx nypm@latest build
```

### Deploy from CI/CD via GitHub actions

First, obtain your Azure Functions Publish Profile and add it as a secret to your GitHub repository settings following [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure/functions-action#using-publish-profile-as-deployment-credential-recommended).

Then create the following file as a workflow:

```yaml [.github/workflows/azure.yml]
name: azure
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-latest ]
        node: [ 14 ]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Get yarn cache directory path
        id: yarn-cache-dir-path
        run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(yarn cache dir)"

      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        id: yarn-cache
        with:
          path: ${{ steps.yarn-cache-dir-path.outputs.dir }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-azure

      - name: Install Dependencies
        if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        run: yarn

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        env:
          NITRO_PRESET: azure_functions

      - name: 'Deploy to Azure Functions'
        uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
        with:
          app-name: <your-app-name>
          package: .output/deploy.zip
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

### Optimizing Azure functions

Consider [turning on immutable packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-run-package) to support running your app from the zip file. This can speed up cold starts.
