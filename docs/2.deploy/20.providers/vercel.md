# Vercel

> Deploy Nitro apps to Vercel.

**Preset:** `vercel`

:read-more{title="Vercel Framework Support" to="https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks"}

::note
Integration with this provider is possible with [zero configuration](/deploy#zero-config-providers).
::

## Getting started

Deploying to Vercel comes with the following features, among others:

- [Preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments)
- [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/docs/fluid-compute)
- [Observability](https://vercel.com/docs/observability)
- [Vercel Firewall](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-firewall)

Learn more in [the Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

### Deploy with Git

Vercel supports Nitro with zero configuration. [Deploy Nitro to Vercel now](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fnitro).

## API routes

Nitro's top-level `/api` directory isn't compatible with Vercel. Use the `routes/api/` directory instead.

## Bun runtime

:read-more{title="Vercel" to="https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/bun"}

You can use [Bun](https://bun.com) instead of Node.js by specifying the runtime using the `vercel.functions` key inside `nitro.config`:

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  vercel: {
    functions: {
      runtime: "bun1.x"
    }
  }
})
```

Alternatively, Nitro also detects Bun automatically if you specify a `bunVersion` property in your `vercel.json`:

```json [vercel.json]
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "bunVersion": "1.x"
}
```

## Per-route function configuration

Use `vercel.functionRules` to override [serverless function settings](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/primitives#serverless-function-configuration) for specific routes. Each key is a route pattern and its value is a partial function configuration object that gets merged with the base `vercel.functions` config.

::note
Array properties (e.g., `regions`) from route config replace the base config arrays rather than merging with them.
::

This is useful when certain routes need different resource limits, regions, or features like [Vercel Queues triggers](https://vercel.com/docs/queues).

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  vercel: {
    functionRules: {
      "/api/heavy-computation": {
        maxDuration: 800,
        memory: 4096,
      },
      "/api/regional": {
        regions: ["lhr1", "cdg1"],
      },
      "/api/queues/process-order": {
        experimentalTriggers: [{ type: "queue/v2beta", topic: "orders" }],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Route patterns support wildcards via [rou3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3) matching (e.g., `/api/slow/**` matches all routes under `/api/slow/`).

## Proxy route rules

Nitro automatically optimizes `proxy` route rules on Vercel by generating [CDN-level rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/rewrites) at build time. This means matching requests are proxied at the edge without invoking a serverless function, reducing latency and cost.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // Proxied at CDN level, no function invocation
    "/api/**": {
      proxy: "https://api.example.com/**",
    },
  },
});
```

### When CDN rewrites apply

A proxy rule is offloaded to a Vercel CDN rewrite when **all** of the following are true:

- The target is an **external URL** (starts with `http://` or `https://`).
- No advanced `ProxyOptions` are set on the rule.

### Fallback to runtime proxy

When the proxy rule uses any of the following `ProxyOptions`, Nitro keeps it as a runtime proxy handled by the serverless function:

- `headers`: custom headers on the outgoing request to the upstream
- `forwardHeaders` / `filterHeaders`: header filtering
- `fetchOptions`: custom fetch options
- `cookieDomainRewrite` / `cookiePathRewrite`: cookie manipulation
- `onResponse`: response callback

::note
Response headers defined on the route rule via the `headers` option are still applied to CDN-level rewrites. Only request-level `ProxyOptions.headers` (sent to the upstream) require a runtime proxy.
::

## Scheduled tasks (Cron Jobs)

:read-more{title="Vercel Cron Jobs" to="https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs"}

Nitro automatically converts your [`scheduledTasks`](/docs/tasks#scheduled-tasks) configuration into [Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs) at build time. Define your schedules in your Nitro config and deploy. No manual `vercel.json` cron configuration is required.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    tasks: true
  },
  scheduledTasks: {
    // Run `cms:update` every hour
    '0 * * * *': ['cms:update'],
    // Run `db:cleanup` every day at midnight
    '0 0 * * *': ['db:cleanup']
  }
})
```

### Secure cron job endpoints

:read-more{title="Securing cron jobs" to="https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/manage-cron-jobs#securing-cron-jobs"}

To prevent unauthorized access to the cron handler, set a `CRON_SECRET` environment variable in your Vercel project settings. When `CRON_SECRET` is set, Nitro validates the `Authorization` header on every cron invocation and rejects mismatches with `401`.

::warning
`CRON_SECRET` is **not** set by default. Matching [Vercel's own behaviour](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/manage-cron-jobs#securing-cron-jobs), the cron endpoint (`/_vercel/cron`, configurable via [`vercel.cronHandlerRoute`](#other-preset-options)) performs no authentication when the variable is missing. Anyone who knows the route can then pick a schedule with the `x-vercel-cron-schedule` header and run the tasks registered for it on demand. Always set `CRON_SECRET` when using `scheduledTasks` on Vercel.
::

## Queues

:read-more{title="Vercel Queues" to="https://vercel.com/docs/queues"}

Nitro integrates with [Vercel Queues](https://vercel.com/docs/queues) to process messages asynchronously. Define your queue topics in the Nitro config and handle incoming messages with the `vercel:queue` runtime hook.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  // Standalone Nitro scans `serverDir` for routes and plugins
  serverDir: "./server",
  vercel: {
    queues: {
      triggers: [
        // Only `topic` is required
        { topic: "notifications" },
        { topic: "orders", retryAfterSeconds: 60, initialDelaySeconds: 5 },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

### Handling messages

Use the `vercel:queue` hook in a [Nitro plugin](/docs/plugins) to process incoming queue messages:

```ts [server/plugins/queues.ts]
import { definePlugin } from "nitro";

export default definePlugin((nitroApp) => {
  nitroApp.hooks.hook("vercel:queue", ({ message, metadata, send }) => {
    console.log(`[${metadata.topicName}] Message ${metadata.messageId}:`, message);
  });
});
```

### Running tasks from queue messages

You can use queue messages to trigger [Nitro tasks](/docs/tasks):

```ts [server/plugins/queues.ts]
import { definePlugin } from "nitro";
import { runTask } from "nitro/task";

export default definePlugin((nitroApp) => {
  nitroApp.hooks.hook("vercel:queue", async ({ message, metadata }) => {
    if (metadata.topicName === "orders") {
      await runTask("orders:fulfill", { payload: message });
    }
  });
});
```

### Sending messages

Use the `@vercel/queue` package directly to send messages to a topic:

```ts [server/routes/api/orders.post.ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro";
import { send } from "@vercel/queue";

export default defineHandler(async (event) => {
  const order = await event.req.json();
  const { messageId } = await send("orders", order);
  return { messageId };
});
```

### Local development

Queues work in `nitro dev`: `send()` delivers messages straight to your `vercel:queue` hook, so you can iterate without deploying. Pull your Vercel environment first with `vercel link` and `vercel env pull` so the SDK can authenticate.

If your hook throws, the message is retried locally. Retries honor `retryAfterSeconds` from each trigger when set.

## Custom build output configuration

You can provide additional [build output configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) using the `vercel.config` key inside `nitro.config`. It will be merged with the built-in auto-generated config.

## Public asset caching

Public asset directories that do not fall through (the default for any non-root `baseURL`) are served by Vercel's CDN straight from the filesystem, with a `Cache-Control` header built from the directory's `maxAge`. Directories without an explicit `maxAge` are cached for one year, which is a Vercel-specific default kept for backwards compatibility.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  publicAssets: [
    {
      baseURL: "build",
      dir: "public/build",
      maxAge: 3600,
    },
  ],
})
```

A request under such a base that does not match a file returns `404` with `Cache-Control: no-store` instead of reaching the server function. This mirrors the Nitro runtime, which also responds `404` for a missing asset under a non-fallthrough base, and it keeps dynamic content from being served — and then cached for the lifetime of the `max-age` — under an asset URL.

Set `maxAge: 0` to opt out of the one-year default. No `Cache-Control` header is then generated for the base:

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
  publicAssets: [
    {
      baseURL: "build",
      dir: "public/build",
      maxAge: 0,
    },
  ],
})
```

A `cache-control` route rule for the base takes precedence over both, so a directory can be served with a custom header instead:

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
  routeRules: {
    "/build/**": { headers: { "cache-control": "no-cache" } },
  },
})
```

::note
Falling-through directories are unaffected, including the top-level `public/` directory, which defaults to `fallthrough: true`. A missing file there still reaches your application handlers.

## Immutable static files

::important
This feature is currently only available in the [nightly release channel](/docs/nightly) of Nitro v3.
::

<!-- :read-more{title="Immutable static files" to="https://vercel.com/docs/skew-protection"} -->

Client build assets (such as JS and CSS chunks) can be emitted as **immutable static files**. These are served from the reserved `/_vercel/immutable/` path so they are shared across deployments and keep resolving even after a newer deployment no longer references them, improving cross-deployment caching.

This feature is opt-in. Enable it with the `vercel.immutableStaticFiles` option or by setting the `NITRO_VERCEL_IMMUTABLE_STATIC_FILES_ENABLED` environment variable.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  vercel: {
    immutableStaticFiles: true
  }
})
```

When enabled, Nitro emits content-addressed build assets under `/_vercel/immutable/`.

::note
The [`VERCEL_HASH_SALT`](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables/system-environment-variables) system environment variable is factored into the generated asset paths, providing a way to rotate them.
::

::warning
Immutable static files must be served from the reserved `/_vercel/immutable/` path, so they are not supported when using a non-root `baseURL`. In that case Nitro skips the immutable output and warns during the build.
::

::note
This works out of the box with the **Nitro + Vite** integration: Nitro's Vercel preset sets `buildAssetsDir` config and the Vite plugin automatically applies it as the `assetsDir` for the client and server-rendered builds, so all generated asset URLs point under `/_vercel/immutable/`.

Client build setups and frameworks must apply `nitro.options.buildAssetsDir` themselves. Use it as the client bundler's asset output directory (base) so generated asset URLs are emitted under that path. Without this, assets are still emitted at their default location and the immutable manifest will not match.
::

## Other preset options

Additional options are available under the `vercel` key in your Nitro config:

- `entryFormat`: Handler format for Vercel Functions. `"web"` (default) or `"node"`. The `node` format enables compatibility with Node.js specific APIs (e.g., `req.runtime.node`).
- `regions`: List of [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions#edge-function-regions) for edge functions.
- `skewProtection`: Set to `false` to disable the Nitro [skew protection](https://vercel.com/docs/skew-protection) integration (enabled by default when skew protection is enabled in the Vercel dashboard).
- `cronHandlerRoute`: Route path for the Vercel cron handler endpoint used with `scheduledTasks` (default: `"/_vercel/cron"`).

## On-demand incremental static regeneration (ISR)

On-demand revalidation lets you purge the cache for an ISR route whenever you want, without waiting for the interval used by background revalidation.

::warning
Do not combine the `isr` and `prerender` route rules on the same route. Prerendered pages are written as static files at build time and Vercel serves them from the filesystem before the ISR function is reached, so `isr` never applies. Use `isr` alone when you need regeneration after deployment.
::

To revalidate a page on demand:

1. Create an environment variable to store a revalidation secret
    - You can use the command `openssl rand -base64 32` or [Generate a Secret](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) to generate a random value.

2. Update your configuration:

    ```ts [nitro.config.ts]
    import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

    export default defineConfig({
      vercel: {
        config: {
          bypassToken: process.env.VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN
        }
      }
    })
    ```

3. To revalidate a path to a Prerender Function on demand, make a GET or HEAD request to that path with an `x-prerender-revalidate: <bypassToken>` header. When the Prerender Function endpoint is accessed with this header set, the cache is revalidated, and the next request to that function should return a fresh response.

### Fine-grained ISR config via route rules

By default, query params affect cache keys but are not passed to the route handler unless specified.

You can pass an options object to the `isr` route rule to configure caching behavior:

- `expiration`: Expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset is re-generated by invoking the Serverless Function. Setting the value to `false` (or the `isr: true` route rule) means it never expires.
- `group`: Group number of the asset. Prerendered assets with the same group number are all re-validated at the same time.
- `allowQuery`: List of query string parameter names that are cached independently.
  - If an empty array, query values are not considered for caching.
  - If `undefined`, each unique query value is cached independently.
  - For wildcard `/**` route rules, `url` is always added.
- `passQuery`: When `true`, the query string is present on the `request` argument passed to the invoked function. The `allowQuery` filter still applies.
- `exposeErrBody`: When `true`, expose the response body regardless of status code, including error status codes (default: `false`).

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  routeRules: {
    "/products/**": {
      isr: {
        allowQuery: ["q"],
        passQuery: true,
        exposeErrBody: true
      },
    },
  },
});
```
